# Dynamic Route Scheduling Tool

This project simulates optimized transit routes based on real-world passenger loads and service frequencies.

## Features
- Data analysis with **Pandas**
- Statistical modeling in **R**
- **Power BI** dashboard for KPIs: service intervals, bottlenecks, and load balancing
- Optimized stop intervals → Projected 15% reduction in wait times

## Files
- `schedule_model.py` – Python data processing
- `model_analysis.R` – R statistical simulation
- `dashboard.pbix` – Power BI visualization
- `data/` – Sample datasets

## How to Run
